## 📌 About the Bootcamp

This is a **2-day beginner-friendly bootcamp** designed to introduce participants to Python programming.

* **Day 1 (1 hour):** Basics of Python, Variables, Data Types, Operators, Control Flow
* **Day 2 (1 hour):** Functions, Data Structures, and a Mini Project (Number Guessing Game / Calculator)

By the end of the bootcamp, you’ll be able to:
✅ Write simple Python programs
✅ Understand variables, loops, and conditions
✅ Use functions & data structures
✅ Build a mini project in Python

👉 Pro tip: Add a **banner image** (with Python + Bootcamp text) at the top of the README for a cool look.

Do you want me to also make a **banner image design idea** for your README (something eye-catching for GitHub)?
